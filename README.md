# Background
Renting an place is becoming increasingly expensive especially in the bay area. It's best to shop around until you find a few apartments that suits your needs. However, how does one go about comparing 2 or more apartments without knowing about all the expenses involved?

Usually, a renter needs to apply & pay a holding deposit (non-refundable in some cases) to get the lease in order to know all the expenses they'll incur.

# Goal
Empower renters to make the best choice of apartments given their needs & budget.

# Solution
Build an advanced rent calculator to estimate the total cost of renting. A renter can use this calculator to ask educated questions to the leasing agent or property manager to get estimate numbers for different categories of expenses.

Total cost of renting provides a tangible way to compare apartments.

# Limitation of this solution
This solution doesn't take into account the intangibles: how new is the apartment, what amenties come with the apartment, etc.

# Deployment
npm run deploy

# Notes
The static react app + github pages application is setup using the following tutorial: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
